  <h1 style="font-size:30px;text-align: center;background-color:#ffcccc;">Photography education</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">

    <p style="font-size:20px;">Photography classes in universities usually tell a lot of theoretical knowledge according to textbooks. For photography lovers, theory is important, but it can't be at the expense of our interest in photography. Commercial photography training institutions will teach you to take qualified commercial photography photos in the shortest time, but too much emphasis on modular teaching can not guide students to find their own characteristics, which will pinch students into ordinary shutter pressing robots without personality. Obviously, we need more relaxed, effective and responsible photography training. The photography class of Mantu education is relaxed, pleasant and productive. What we want to teach is actually very simple: one is aesthetics, the other is realization. I need to teach students to think and find their own aesthetic perspective, and then learn to use the camera to realize and express it. I will not preach rigid "requirements", nor will I have the same aesthetic "standards" - everyone's personality is different, so you should create completely different photography works that only belong to you.</p>
  <h1 style="font-size:30px;text-align: center;background-color:#ffcccc;">Makeup Education</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Makeup Education.jpg"style="width:600px;height:480px;">

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;text-align: center;background-color:#ffcccc;">Post education</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Post education.jpg"style="width:600px;height:480px;">
  <p style="font-size:20px;">With the advent of the digital age, various industries have more and more demand for post graphic repairers. With the emergence of various post graphic repair software, the professional requirements of graphic repairers are getting higher and higher. If you want not to be eliminated, you must keep learning and making progress in order to keep pace with the times. Mantulais is a first-class master in the later stage of practical teaching.
